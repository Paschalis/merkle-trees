# merkle-trees
Implementation of Merkle Trees for fun :)

## how to run the tests
1. Make sure you have python installed.
2. For merkle_tree tests: `python -m unittest test_merkle_tree.py` in command line.

## module merkle_tree.py
- create a merkle tree
- calculate proof-of-inclusion for a value
- verify proof-of-inclusion given the proof, the root and a value
- add a value to the merkle tree
- update a value of the merkle tree
- print all levels of the merkle tree
